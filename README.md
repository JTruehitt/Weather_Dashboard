# Weather Dashboard

## Description
For this project, I was tasked with building a dynamic and responsive weather dashboard using the OpenWeatherMap API. The deployed app takes a user location input and displays the current weather, as well as the upcoming 5 day forecast. The app will store and display the user’s last 5 searches as interactive buttons to recall the weather for those locations. The user is also able to set a shown location as primary, which will render the conditions of this location for the user on load of the application moving forward. The application was build with responsiveness in mind, so it will look great on mobile, desktop, and any sizes in-between.

This was my first deep dive into working with server side APIs, and coming out of this I have a much deeper knowledge of how sites dynamically request, parse, and render data. Specifically, I’ve furthered my understanding of the following concepts:
- querying APIs and handling the response
- Parsing through the API response and picking out the desired data
- Dynamically rendering and changing content on a page based on the data received from an API
- Element location, manipulation, and DOM traversal with jQuery
- Responsive design utilizing some bootstrap in combination with custom CSS
- Building query URLs based on user text input
- Data validation to improve user experience and minimize errors
- Utilizing function parameters to transfer needed data between functions
